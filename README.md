## Introduction

This is a basic implementation of a multiband compressor utilizing the JUCE framework. 
- A three-band compressor with threshold, ratio and attack
- Global Gain Controls
- A Spectrum Analyzer
- Bypass, Solo, and Mute Buttons for each band
- Customizable crossover frequencies
- Ableton Live inspired design

# TODO

- [x] Fix Control Bar Appearance
- [x] Tune Colours
- [x] Make Spectrum Analyzer Background a much darker gray in order to improve contrast
- [x] Fix Control Bar Appearance
- [x] Change the Power Button to Abletons style (an orange circle with a thin black outline)
- [ ] Analyzer Button needs to be slightly to the right
- [ ] Search for a better font for the buttons
- [ ] Make the font bold in the band select buttons as well as their respective bypass, solo and mute buttons
- [ ] Make the Spectrum Analyzer Graph rounder, maybe using bezier curves
- [ ] Add a Short decay time to the spectrum analyzer, leaving a trail of the previous peaks
